# Description

This Vagrant environment and Vagrantfile helps create a three-VM EMC ScaleIO lab setup, with Flocker built from source, on CentOS 7

# Usage

- **Tested with Vagrant 1.7.2**
- **Tested with CentOS 7**
- Scripts have been maunually run on a 3 node Amazon AWS cluster runing CentOS 7 AMI as well, though this is not automated in the current repo with ```--provider``` flag

Desclaimer (This takes a while to setup). If you want an easier way to install a 4 Node setup to test out flocker with scaleio, then visit (https://github.com/wallnerryan/flocker-scaleio-singlenode)

Get the source
```
git clone https://github.com/emccode/flocker-drivers

cd demo/scaleio
```

Copy the RPMS into the source directory
[You can download ScaleIO Here](http://www.emc.com/products-solutions/trial-software-download/scaleio.htm)
```
cp EMC-ScaleIO-callhome-1.31-243.0.el7.x86_64.rpm E MC-ScaleIO-sdc-1.31-243.0.el7.x86_64.rpm
EMC-ScaleIO-gateway-1.31-243.0.noarch.rpm  EMC-ScaleIO-sds-1.31-243.0.el7.x86_64.rpm
EMC-ScaleIO-gui-1.31-243.0.noarch.rpm  EMC-ScaleIO-tb-1.31-243.0.el7.x86_64.rpm
EMC-ScaleIO-lia-1.31-243.0.el7.x86_64.rpm EMC-ScaleIO-mdm-1.31-243.0.el7.x86_64.rpm
```

Copy the certs (if needed) into source/certs
```
cp CompanySSL.crt CompanyCA.crt certs/
```

# Start vagrant
**Note, this takes a while to install, because we're installing a new kernel and ZFS, hopefully we'll be able to use custom boxes to streamline this in the near future**
```
vagrant up
```

# Examples

Your 3 Nodes containing ScaleIO + Flocker will be on a private address space
in virtualbox. The example at the time of running this used vboxnet1 192.168.50.1/24

The plugin (https://github.com/emccode/flocker-drivers/scaleio) should come installed in this
environment, as well as cluster certificates and services started.

The SIO driver is set up in this way
```
version: 1
control-service:
  hostname: "control-service"
dataset:
  backend: "scaleio_flocker_driver"
  username: "admin"
  password: "Scaleio123"
  mdm: "192.168.50.12"
  protection_domain: "pdomain"
  ssl: True
```

Use the Flocker Docker Plugin
```
vagrant ssh mdm2
docker run -ti -v test:/data --volume-driver=flocker busybox sh
```

You should see a volume created in the Volume CLI (See how to use volumes CLI below)

Use the Volumes CLI (flocker-volumes cli is located in /opt/flocker/flocker-<version>/flocker-tools/bin/)
```
(Create a volume)
cd /etc/flocker/
1. /opt/flocker/flocker-1.0.0/flocker-tools/bin/flocker-volumes --control-service=tb.scaleio.local create --node=8700ae98 --size=8589934592 --metadata="requester=yourname"
2. /opt/flocker/flocker-1.0.0/flocker-tools/bin/flocker-volumes --control-service=tb.scaleio.local list
3. /opt/flocker/flocker-1.0.0/flocker-tools/bin/flocker-volumes --control-service=tb.scaleio.local list-nodes
```

Example Output
```
/opt/flocker/flocker-1.0.0/flocker-tools/bin/flocker-volumes --control-service=tb.scaleio.local list
DATAASET                               SIZE    METADATA             STATUS            SERVER                   
59159c8c-2fde-430d-9fd7-7fe5092abc12   8.00G                        attached          649b2006 (192.168.50.13)
a9f38503-0cc8-46de-9d44-dd3ac350b2d6   8.00G   createdfor=testing   attached          649b2006 (192.168.50.13)
```

You can also view the volumes and nodes in the UI, point your Vagrant Host Browser to ```http://127.0.0.1:8080/client/#/nodes/list?sortDir=ASC```

Here is a fig file (mongo-application.yml) (you can find this in this repo as well under ./examples)

```
"version": 1
"applications":
  "mongodbserver":
    "image": "clusterhq/mongodb"
    "volume":
      "mountpoint": "/data/db"
      "maximum_size": "8589934592"
    "ports":
    - "internal": 27017
      "external": 27017
  "mongodbconn":
    "image": "wallnerryan/mongoconn"
    "ports":
    - "internal": 8080
      "external": 8080
```

Here is a deployment file (mongo-deployment-1node.yml)

```
"version": 1
"nodes":
 "192.168.50.11": ["mongodbserver", "mongodbconn"]
 "192.168.50.12": []
 "192.168.50.13": []
```

Run the example (flocker-deploy is located in /opt/flocker/flocker-<version>/flocker-cli/bin/)
```
flocker-deploy mongo-deployment-1node.yml mongo-application.yml
```

**You should be able to see the volumes on the node (tb == 192.168.50.11)**
```
[root@tb flocker-emc]# /bin/emc/scaleio/drv_cfg --query_vols
Retrieved 1 volume(s)
VOL-ID aea92e8700000000 MDM-ID 62a34bc20b360b1c
```

You should be able go to a web browser 192.168.50.11:8080 and see the app is connected to MongoDB

![Alt text](examples/connected.png?raw=true)

Also view the containers on the node (Image shows 192.168.50.11)

![Alt text](examples/bothcontainers.png?raw=true)

Here is a deployment file (mongo-deployment-2node.yml)

```
"version": 1
"nodes":
 "192.168.50.11": ["mongodbconn"]
 "192.168.50.12": ["mongodbserver"]
 "192.168.50.13": []
```

Run the flocker-deploy example to move the app
```
flocker-deploy mongo-deployment-2node.yml mongo-application.yml
```

You should be able go to a web browser 192.168.50.11:8080 and see the app is NOT connected to MongoDB while MongoDB is moving, this is temporary, you may look at the log to see the connection status for ```flocker--mongodbconn```

![Alt text](examples/cannot_connect.png?raw=true)

You should see 1 container on each host after the ```mongodbserver``` is migrated.

(Image shows 192.168.50.11)

![Alt text](examples/mongoconnonly.png?raw=true)

(Image shows 192.168.50.12)

![Alt text](examples/mongodbonly.png?raw=true)

After the mongodbserver is succesfully migrated, You should be able go to a web browser 192.168.50.11:8080 and see the app is again connected to MongoDB.

You should also see the volume has moved to the new host.

**You should be able to see the volumes on the node (mdm1 == 192.168.50.12)**
```
[root@mdm1 flocker-emc]# /bin/emc/scaleio/drv_cfg --query_vols
Retrieved 1 volume(s)
VOL-ID aea92e8700000000 MDM-ID 62a34bc20b360b1c
```

# Cluster

Each node in the cluster will house the ScaleIO tooling, SDC/SDS for
volume access, Docker and Flocker in the above example, you can see this
sshing into any node and follow the below

```
vagrant ssh <tb|mdm1|mdm2>

```

```
[vagrant@tb ~]$ sudo docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
```

```
[vagrant@tb ~]$ sudo zpool status

# Caveats

Working with vagrant's insecure private key working correctly, flocker-deploy should
not ask for a password as long as you run the below command from you CLI node

```
[ -e "${SSH_AUTH_SOCK}" ] || eval $(ssh-agent) && ssh-add ~/.vagrant.d/insecure_private_key
```

Test that this is working correctly against the tb node.
(It should response unknown because we built flocker-node from source?)
```
you@yourmachine:~ ssh root@192.168.50.11 flocker-reportstate --version
unknown
```

# Future

- Automate environment to use custom vagrant boxes to speed up deployment
- Don't install from source, rather install from official packages
- Automate certificate creation and service startup for flocker+scaleio driver
